Thats how it happened but you go ahead and pick the story you like.

												<div align="left">Well, Dean and I were talkin on the phone and decided to start a band so we asked a friend of mine if hed like to do it and he said yes. But there was a problem Dean didnt have a guitar, I didnt have a drumset and my friend, the only one with an instrument, wasnt to into it. So, we kicked him out and picked up Pete who only had an acoustic guitar, but would try. So now we had a singer/guitarist a lead guitarist and, me , a drummer, no one with an instrument and we were short a bassist. Well one day dean heard about ricky playing bass so he asked him and ricky actually had a usable bass so now we finally had a band. But, we needed two things, instruments and a name.
